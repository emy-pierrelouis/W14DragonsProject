                    <h2>Before you choose: Know the Species</h2>                
                    <p>Dragons and their various subtypes have been a staple of mythologies, folklore, and fantasy literature for centuries. Each subtype carries unique characteristics, appearances, and abilities that set them apart from one another. Here, we will delve into the differences between the dragon subspecies that we have to offer: drakes, wyverns, dragons, wyrms, leviathans, sea serpents, quetzalcoatls, and landwyrms.</p>
                </div>

                <div>
                    <div class="hint">
                        <h3 id="drake">Drakes</h3>
                        <img src="Images\Dragons\drake.png" class="type" width="200">
                    </div>
                    <p>Drakes are often portrayed as lesser dragons, possessing traits similar to traditional dragons but generally smaller in size and less powerful. They might lack the ability to breathe fire or have a more animalistic demeanor. Drakes are often depicted as quadrupedal creatures with wings and may or may not possess intelligence akin to other dragon types.</p>
                </div>

                <div>
                    <div class="hint">
                        <h3 id="wyvern">Wyverns</h3>
                        <img src="Images\Dragons\wyvern.png" class="type" width="200">
                    </div>
                    <p>Wyverns are distinct for their two-legged stance, resembling a cross between a dragon and a bird. Unlike traditional dragons, wyverns typically have no forelimbs, relying on their wings and powerful hind legs for mobility and combat. They often have a more reptilian appearance and are usually depicted as being slightly smaller than traditional dragons.</p>
                </div>

                <div>
                    <div class="hint">

                    </div>
                    <p>Dragons are the most iconic and versatile of the dragon subtypes. They can vary greatly in size, appearance, abilities, and temperament. They usually possess four legs, wings, and the ability to breathe fire or some other elemental power. Dragons are often portrayed as intelligent, wise, and powerful creatures, often having complex personalities and roles in the stories they inhabit.</p>
                </div>

                <div>
                    <div class="hint">
                        <h3 id="wyrm">Wyrm</h3>
                        <img src="Images\Dragons\wyrm.png" class="type" width="200">
                    </div>
                    <p>Wyrms are often depicted as long, serpentine dragons. They might have either no limbs or very small, vestigial ones. Wyrms are associated with deep underground lairs and a connection to the earth. Unlike traditional dragons, wyrms might not have the ability to fly and could be more oriented towards subterranean environments.</p>
                </div>

                <div>
                    <div class="hint">
                        <h3 id="leviathan">Leviathans</h3>

                    </div>
                    <p>Leviathans are massive sea creatures, often more akin to sea monsters than the traditional concept of a dragon. They are known for their immense size and connection to the ocean depths. Unlike airborne dragons, leviathans are frequently associated with water, and their appearance might vary from a massive serpent to a more unique aquatic beast.</p>
                </div>

                <div>
                    <div class="hint">

                    </div>
                    <p>Sea serpents are elongated aquatic creatures that resemble giant snakes or serpents. They're typically found in oceans, lakes, or other large bodies of water. Unlike other dragons, they lack wings and are adapted for life underwater. Sea serpents often play a role in maritime mythology and can be either benevolent or menacing in nature.</p>
                </div>

                <div>
                    <div class="hint">

                    </div>
                    <p>Quetzalcoatl is a Mesoamerican deity often depicted as a feathered serpent. While not strictly a dragon in the Western sense, it shares some similarities. Quetzalcoatl is associated with both the sky and earth, symbolizing creation and destruction. Its appearance combines avian and serpentine features, reflecting a unique cultural interpretation of dragon-like qualities.</p>
                </div>

                <div>
                    <div class="hint">

                    </div>
                    <p>Landwyrms, as the name suggests, are dragon-like creatures that inhabit land environments. They might have unique adaptations suited for specific terrains, such as camouflage or burrowing capabilities. Landwyrms are a more specific subtype, emphasizing their connection to terrestrial habitats rather than being all-encompassing like the term "dragon."</p>
